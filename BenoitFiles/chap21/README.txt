jinmodel.m
Schematic animation of the jin model (Figures 21-7 and 21-9). The time solution (Figure 21-8) is used
to animate the different perturbations (wind, temperature, thermocline depth) over time.

jin.m
Function which defines the two differential equations of the jin model. 

soi.m
Script which reads SOI indexes and produces Figure 21-6.

soiread.m
Function which reads the SOI indexes and when requested applies a temporal filtering.
